# 1. Two Sum
难度: Easy
```
Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:

Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].
```

```python
class Solution(object):
    def twoSum(self, nums, target):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type target: int
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        lookup = {}
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            if target - num in lookup:
                return [lookup[target-num], i]
            else:
                lookup[num] = i
```
# 7. Reverse Integer
难度: Easy
```
Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.

Example 1:

Input: 123
Output: 321
Example 2:

Input: -123
Output: -321
Example 3:

Input: 120
Output: 21
Note:
Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−231,  231 − 1]. For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.
```

```python
class Solution(object):
    def reverse(self, x):
        """
        :type x: int
        :rtype: int
        """    
        x = -int(str(x)[::-1][:-1]) if x < 0 else int(str(x)[::-1])   # [:-1]相当于把负号去掉
        x = 0 if abs(x) > 0x7FFFFFFF else x
        return x
```

# 9. Palindrome Number
难度: Easy
```
Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

Example 1:

Input: 121
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
Example 3:

Input: 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
Follow up:

Coud you solve it without converting the integer to a string?
```

```python
class Solution(object):
    def isPalindrome(self, x):
        """
        :type x: int
        :rtype: bool
        """
        if x < 0 or (x != 0 and x % 10 == 0):
            return False
        rev, y = 0, x
        while x > 0:
            rev = rev * 10 + x % 10
            x /= 10
        return y == rev
```

#  13.Roman to Integer
难度: Easy
```
Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.

Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000
For example, two is written as II in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. Twelve is written as, XII, which is simply X + II. The number twenty seven is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 
X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. 
C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.
Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer. Input is guaranteed to be within the range from 1 to 3999.

Example 1:

Input: "III"
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: "IV"
Output: 4
Example 3:

Input: "IX"
Output: 9
Example 4:

Input: "LVIII"
Output: 58
Explanation: C = 100, L = 50, XXX = 30 and III = 3.
Example 5:

Input: "MCMXCIV"
Output: 1994
Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.
```

```python
class Solution(object):
    def romanToInt(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: int
        """
        lookup = {
            'I': 1,
            'V': 5,
            'X': 10,
            'L': 50,
            'C': 100,
            'D': 500,
            'M': 1000
        }
        res = 0
        for i in range(len(s)):
            if i > 0 and lookup[s[i]] > lookup[s[i-1]]:
                res += lookup[s[i]] - 2 * lookup[s[i-1]]
            else:
                res += lookup[s[i]]
        return res
```

#  14. Longest Common Prefix
难度: Easy
```
Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".

Example 1:

Input: ["flower","flow","flight"]
Output: "fl"
Example 2:

Input: ["dog","racecar","car"]
Output: ""
Explanation: There is no common prefix among the input strings.
Note:

All given inputs are in lowercase letters a-z.
```

```python
class Solution:
    def longestCommonPrefix(self, strs):
        """
        :type strs: List[str]
        :rtype: str
        """
        if not strs:
            return ''
        dp = [strs[0]] * len(strs)
        for i in range(1, len(strs)):
            while not strs[i].startswith(dp[i-1]):
                dp[i-1] = dp[i-1][:-1]
            dp[i] = dp[i-1]
        return dp[-1]
```
# 20. Valid Parentheses
难度: Easy
```
Given a string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
Note that an empty string is also considered valid.

Example 1:

Input: "()"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: "()[]{}"
Output: true
Example 3:

Input: "(]"
Output: false
Example 4:

Input: "([)]"
Output: false
Example 5:

Input: "{[]}"
Output: true
```

```python
class Solution:
    def isValid(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: bool
        """
        while '[]' in s or '()' in s or '{}' in s:
            s = s.replace('[]','').replace('()','').replace('{}','')
        return len(s) == 0
```

# 21. Merge Two Sorted Lists
难度: Easy
```
Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a new list. The new list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Example:

Input: 1->2->4, 1->3->4
Output: 1->1->2->3->4->4
```

```python
class Solution(object):
    def mergeTwoLists(self, l1, l2):
        """
        :type l1: ListNode
        :type l2: ListNode
        :rtype: ListNode
        """
        if not l1:
            return l2
        if not l2:
            return l1
        
        dummy = cur = ListNode(-1)
        while l1 and l2:
            if l1.val < l2.val:
                cur.next = l1
                l1 = l1.next
            else:
                cur.next = l2
                l2 = l2.next
            cur = cur.next
            
        cur.next = l1 if l1 else l2
        return dummy.next            
```
# 26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
难度: Easy

```
Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appear only once and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

Example 1:

Given nums = [1,1,2],

Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.

It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
Example 2:

Given nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4],

Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being modified to 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.

It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.
Clarification:

Confused why the returned value is an integer but your answer is an array?

Note that the input array is passed in by reference, which means modification to the input array will be known to the caller as well.

Internally you can think of this:

// nums is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
int len = removeDuplicates(nums);

// any modification to nums in your function would be known by the caller.
// using the length returned by your function, it prints the first len elements.
for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    print(nums[i]);
}
```

```python
class Solution(object):
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        idx = 0
        while idx < len(nums) - 1:
            if nums[idx] == nums[idx+1]:
                nums.pop(idx)
            else:
                idx += 1
        return len(nums)
```
# 27. Remove Element
难度: Easy
```
Given an array nums and a value val, remove all instances of that value in-place and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

The order of elements can be changed. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.

Example 1:

Given nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3,

Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.

It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
Example 2:

Given nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], val = 2,

Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums containing 0, 1, 3, 0, and 4.

Note that the order of those five elements can be arbitrary.

It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.
```

```python
class Solution(object):
    def removeElement(self, nums, val):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type val: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        while val in nums:
            nums.remove(val)
        return len(nums)
```
# 28. Implement strStr()
难度: Easy
```
Implement strStr().

Return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

Example 1:

Input: haystack = "hello", needle = "ll"
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: haystack = "aaaaa", needle = "bba"
Output: -1
Clarification:

What should we return when needle is an empty string? This is a great question to ask during an interview.

For the purpose of this problem, we will return 0 when needle is an empty string. This is consistent to C's strstr() and Java's indexOf().
```

```python
class Solution(object):
    def strStr(self, haystack, needle):
        """
        :type haystack: str
        :type needle: str
        :rtype: int
        """
        return haystack.find(needle)
```
# 35. Search Insert Position
难度: Easy
```
Given a sorted array and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

You may assume no duplicates in the array.

Example 1:

Input: [1,3,5,6], 5
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: [1,3,5,6], 2
Output: 1
Example 3:

Input: [1,3,5,6], 7
Output: 4
Example 4:

Input: [1,3,5,6], 0
Output: 0
```

```python
class Solution(object):
    def searchInsert(self, nums, target):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type target: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        i = 0
        while nums[i] < target:
            i += 1
            if i == len(nums):
                return i
        return i
```

# 38. Count and Say
难度: Easy
```
The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers with the first five terms as following:

1.     1
2.     11
3.     21
4.     1211
5.     111221
1 is read off as "one 1" or 11.
11 is read off as "two 1s" or 21.
21 is read off as "one 2, then one 1" or 1211.
Given an integer n, generate the nth term of the count-and-say sequence.

Note: Each term of the sequence of integers will be represented as a string.

Example 1:

Input: 1
Output: "1"
Example 2:

Input: 4
Output: "1211"
```

```python
class Solution(object):
    def countAndSay(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: str
        """
        if n == 1:
            return '1'
        s = self.countAndSay(n-1) + '*'
        res, count = '', 1
        for i in range(len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[i+1]:
                count += 1
            else:
                res += str(count) + str(s[i])
                count = 1
        return res
```
